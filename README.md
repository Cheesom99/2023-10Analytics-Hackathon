2. **National Strategy for Youth Employment:** This dataset outlines various national strategies adopted across different African countries to combat youth unemployment.

3. **Share of Education in Government Expenditure:** Education is a critical factor in employment. This dataset sheds light on how much governments are investing in education.

4. **Population with Access to Electricity:** Access to electricity is a fundamental driver of economic development and can influence employment opportunities. This dataset provides insights into the availability of electricity across different regions and its potential impact on employment.

5. **Total Firms (Historical Data):** The health of a country's private sector is directly linked to employment rates. This dataset includes historical data on the number of firms.

6. **Country Codes:** This dataset is essential for mapping data points to specific African countries, enabling a more precise and geographically contextual analysis.
